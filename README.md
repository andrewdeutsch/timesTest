At the following url ( http://np-ec2-nytimes-com.s3.amazonaws.com/dev/test/nyregion.js ), you will
find a jsonp file that gives you a list of stories, headlines, summaries and photos about New
York.
Instructions

Create a static webpage following these specifications:

1. Perform a client side request to fetch the contents of the JSONP file.

2. Lay out the stories in a simple list with the information you think should display for each
article. Extra points for making a beautiful, "Timesian" presentation of the list.

3. Ensure the content is legible (i.e. “responsive”), without user intervention, on small and
large screens, including smartphone, tablet, and desktop.

4. Create the ability to toggle between English and a fake Martian language that follows
these rules:

○ every word three characters or less is left alone

○ every word more than three characters is replaced with boinga

○ maintain the same capitalization and punctuation in the English and Martian
versions



5. Must support the following browsers:

○ Latest Chrome

○ Latest Firefox

○ Latest Safari

○ IE11

○ iOS 9+

6. Use git to track changes while you work. We want to see your git history.

7. Upon completion, zip up all code AND your .git folder, and send via email.


○ Do not minify javascript or css files you author


Coding Guidelines

● Use vanilla Javascript, not any compiled-to-JS languages such as coffee script

● Use frameworks and libraries such as JQuery with caution . We will be looking for an
over-reliance on unnecessarily bulky frameworks for this exercise.


Criteria

We will evaluate the code test on the following criteria:

● Simplicity

● Code readability

● Visual aesthetics of page
